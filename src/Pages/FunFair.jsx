          <li>
            🏃‍♀️ <strong>Three-Legged Race:</strong> Two players, one goal — and one leg tied together!
            This hilarious race tests your teamwork, coordination, and balance as you and your partner
            dash (or stumble!) toward the finish line.
          </li>
          <li>
            🎶 <strong>Musical Chairs:</strong> A timeless classic! Walk around the chairs as the music plays — 
            but when it stops, move fast! There’s always one less chair, so stay sharp and stay seated!
          </li>
          <li>
            📰 <strong>Newspaper Dance:</strong> Dance partners, this one’s for you! Dance together on a sheet of newspaper —
            but every time the music stops, fold it smaller. Keep your balance and avoid touching the ground!
          </li>
          <li>
            🕵️‍♀️ <strong>Find the Item:</strong> Channel your inner detective in this fast-paced scavenger hunt! 
            Locate hidden items scattered around — the fastest wins!
          </li>
          <li>
            🐾 <strong>Tail Tag:</strong> Run, dodge, and defend your “tail”! Grab as many as you can while protecting your own — 
            a thrilling mix of speed and strategy.
          </li>
          <li>
            🔥 <strong>The Floor is Lava:</strong> When someone yells “The floor is lava!”, jump onto something that’s not the floor.
            Quick reflexes and creativity will keep you safe!
